          Flow is a productivity website aimed at keeping track of tasks within
          categories. A user can create a new task by clicking the "Create new
          task" button and filling out information within the modal that
          appears. Most time using the program is spent in the Main category
          which I use to contain all of my short-term goals.
        </p>
        <p className={`${paragraphClasses}`}>
          Each flow task contains four values: title, preferred completion date,
          deadline, and notes. While the user can edit the notes on the main
          page by scrolling down in a task window, there's also a detail view
          that gives the user more space to write out their thoughts. In this
          view, the user can click the button on the bottom of the view to
          download the task title and notes in a text file.
